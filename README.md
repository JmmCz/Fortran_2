This solution is using ifort (Intel) and pFUnit (check [here](http://pfunit.sourceforge.net/))

How to run?
Download and unzip all files into one folder (from given zad). Using terminal cd to your folder with downloaded project.

>When in folder, please type *make* to create proper files.
>To run a program in zad1 and zad2 (unit tests using pFUnit) type *./test* (one test should be a failure, six tests ought to work correctly)
>To run a program in zad 3 (compare times mult from zad1, zad2 and MATMUL) type *./program* (defining your own N or first/second matrix data at the beginning of main.F90)
